What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do yo need to do it?

You need to initialize a repository because git needs to know that in this
folder there are files you want to track and if you don't then git can't 
do its job.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?

The staging area acts as a intermediary between working directory and repository.
It has control over what is committed and what is added to the repository history.
